## Core
Customer:
4. Customer could only see his own booking index (not others! need fix)
5. Customer could create and edit favourite address (external table)

Driver:
1. Driver could sign up and edit profile
2. Driver could see the booking index from different customers (only show nearby ones). Driver could not create booking
3. Ignore the car model now, price is only estimated based on the distance. Also ignore the map showing car moving, only show map is fine after booking confirmed
4. Driver could take booking(change to confirmed), start trip (booking started), end trip (booking finished)


Booking:
1. booking has 6 status:new--confirmed--started--finished--paid--reviewed
2. 

* Booking could update could not edit
* Booking could be cancelled (deleted because we don't want unconfirmed booking in the db), customer and driver couldn't really delete the booking (because the other party would also be affected), their 'delete' in their booking histroy is just to hide them
* When booking is created, the default status is 'new'. After a driver takes it, status:"confirmed". After the customer enters the car and driver presses start button, status:"started". After arriving on destination in gps, driver could press finish button (if still far from it then driver couldn't)
